      <p>
        When Nokia, together with Sega, released Pocket Kingdom: Own the
        World on 24 November 2004, it was clear: the N-Gage Arena was
        meant for more than just downloadable content or online
        leaderboards. The time had come for the first mobile MMO game
        for this platform and it was great, even if it didn't last long.
      </p>

      <p class="free-standing">
        Whether someone in Sweden recognised this enormous potential at
        that moment and created SPIRITS, remains unclear, but if Nokia
        hadn't pulled the plug on the N-Gage, we would have been in for
        something that would have left Sega's efforts in the dust.
      </p>

      <p class="free-standing">
        This is the story of SPIRITS. Jadestone's cancelled massively
        multiplayer online dueling game, a title which could have
        potentially turned the tide of the N-Gage with its deep
        mythology and dark, unique atmosphere.

    <h3 id="authors-note">Author's note</h3>

    <p>
      An historical reappraisal of the Nokia N-Gage story may seem
      unusual, or uninteresting to many, but what platform can claim to
      have so many unreleased games? We know of at least 24. Compare
      that to a total of just 55 officially released games, there
      remains yet another 30 percent of titles waiting to be discovered.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the second article in this series and while I'm sure it
      won't be the last, I hope you enjoy reading this and that I can
      get you at least a little inspired about the Nokia N-Gage and its
      history.
    </p>

    <p>
      To cut a long story short: On behalf of the
      entire <a href="#postface">Nokia N-Gage community</a>, I hope you
      enjoy this striking collection of lost media and the story that
      goes with it.
    </p>

    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

    <p>
      The game is pitched as follows:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        We have always sensed their importance. Throughout the history of
        mankind, the four elements have been linked with mysterious
        forces. From ancient religous lore to the mythical pursuits of
        medieval alchemists.<br>

        The true nature of the elemental powers is both wonderful and
        frightening. Our planet is teeming with mysterious and powerful
        spirit beings, connected to the four elements: earth, water,
        wind and fire. They can’t be seen, but [their] influence
        stretches from the slightest whiff of wind to the most fearsome
        earthquake.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the game SPIRITS, modern technology has closed the gap between
        our world and the spirit dimension. The immense power of the
        elements can now be used for good or evil.  Unfortunately, evil is
        a step ahead…

    <h4 id="development">Development</h4>

    <p>
      It all started quite businesslike and practical back in 2002 with
      a concept, whose game and technical design were further refined
      during the course of 2003, until around December of the same year,
      when Jadestone started to turn it into a demo for Symbian S60
      phones, which was never intended for the consumer market. This was
      developed to showcase a practical use case for the SIP protocol
      that Nokia was promoting at the time<label for="sn-1"

    <p>
      <q>The idea was that you could challenge a friend for a battle and
      your friend didn't have to have the game running when you sent the
      challenge</q>, said Björn Ritzl, who worked together with Per
      Malmén as a programmer on the project, shortly after he joined
      Jadestone. For him, as for many others involved, it was the first
      project he had worked on. <q>The first version of Spirits was
      based on an idea by Johan Mogren</q>, he continued.

    <p>
      After the original demo of the game was delivered in September
      2004, it was already clear that this idea had more potential to
      offer, so Jadestone decided to develop a full-fledged game for the
      consumer market, and to do this for the Nokia N-Gage seemed
      logical — it was a very promising platform at the time, with
      existing online infrastructure and games sold in stores, at retail
      prices. Because of this, Jadestone submitted a proposal as early
      as October 2004.
    </p>

    <p>
      <q>We developed the initial demo game for Nokia and although never
      intended for regular consumers, we all realized that we had a
      really fun and engaging (no pun intended) game. I think it was
      really a nobrainer for us to sell and for Nokia to buy an expanded
      game, with a more ambitious storyline</q>, states Jonas
      Haraldson, former Marketing Director at Jadestone.

    <p>
      Then, in April 2005, a month before E3, marketing planning for the
      game's release began. One week before E3, on May 12, 2005, SPIRITS
      was officially announced and a demo was made available for
      selected media outlets.<label for="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle

      Steve Palley, the GameSpot journalist who covered the demo

      The backstory is as follows:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The main storyline starts with a young girl who has the unusual
        power to see the spirits. In the late 1960s she is abducted in
        order to be used for military research. The goal is to turn
        elemental energy into powerful weapons.<br>

        Things go wrong, however, and raw elemental energy is unleashed,
        with disastrous consequences. As a result, the research program
        is abruptly terminated. The girl is hidden away in a drug
        induced […] coma.

        decimate Earth's overpopulation, the plan is to use her as a

        The memory of those ancient times is buried somewhere in the

        The game is set to be unique in its full integration of PC and
        cellphone in both the gameplay and the business model.

    <p>
      This is the only reference to a PC version. It can be assumed that
      this idea was discarded since it was explicitly mentioned in the
      press report that SPIRITS will only be available on the N-Gage
      platform. It is also possible that the web interface was referred
      to, which I will touch on later.
    </p>

    <h4 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h4>

    <p>
      There are four basic gameplay elements in SPIRITS:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Collecting SPIRITS</li>
      <li>Completing missions</li>
      <li>Dueling other players</li>
      <li>Optimizing your team of SPIRITS to keep it in fighting shape</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The core gameplay in SPIRITS is based on players hunting and
      collecting spirits. Gamers will test their skills in duels where
      tactical thinking, as well as quick reactions, will make all the
      difference. In the race to save mankind, there is only one way to
      win: mastering the elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get new SPIRITS, you'll have to participate in a little
      minigame, called a <i>hunt</i>, where you catch spirits as they
      float around. However, the essential aspect of the game is the
      duel mechanics:  you put together 6 SPIRITS that represent your
      team. Your team and the opponent's team then face each other on an
      isometric arena. To fight, you choose your own SPIRIT with which
      you can target one of your opponent's SPIRITS. The two SPIRITS
      collide and damage points are assigned accordingly. The game is
      turn-based, but since both players make decisions at the same
      time, the game mechanics are loosened up a bit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Besides the core gameplay, there were other features that are
      worth mentioning. For example, Oscar Berg, the web and front-end
      developer involved, talked about a web interface through which the
      player could perform certain activities: <q>If something it might
      be worth while to mention that the n-gage game was going to be
      complemented by a web portal where it was possible to arrange your
      team and trade spirits with your friends</q>. Technically, this
      feature worked, although it was probably not production-ready.
    </p>

    <p>
      Martin Vilcans, one of the programmers, also mentioned another
      idea that was discussed at the time: <q>We even had some ideas of
      letting the device's geolocation affect what type of spirit you
      got when you <i>hunted</i> them. If you were close to water, it
      would be more likely that you get a water spirit for
      example. Comparing the game concept to Pokémon Go is not far off,
      but Spirits had cooler graphics</q>. Ultimately, however, this was
      just an idea that would not have been technically feasible and was
      therefore not investigated further.
    </p>

    <h4 id="the-team">The Team</h4>

    <p>
      These are the people I know were involved in the development of
      SPIRITS. Unfortunately, I can't say for sure that this list is
      complete and I may add to it at a later date.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, it's proving a bit difficult to figure out who worked on the
      main game and demo, and who only worked on one of them. The names
      I know for sure are marked accordingly.

    <h4 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h4>

    <p>
      Later, after Nokia pulled out, Jadestone began to develop a PC MMO
      based on SPIRITS. However, the project was put on ice due to
      funding problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rikard Herlitz, a lead developer at Jadestone, published a short
      video of a tech demo that was developed using
      the <a href="https://jmonkeyengine.org/">jMonkeyEngine</a>.
    </p>

      However, this demo had little to do with the original vision of
      SPIRITS, but rather resembled a fantasy-oriented MMO comparable to
      Word of Warcraft. Johan Mogren concurred, adding: <q>From my
      perspective, it was central that the player was playing as
      himself, not an avatar</q>.
    </p>

    <h4 id="trivia">Trivia</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        During its development, the game was given the preliminary title
        <i>Spirits — The Vivid Resistance</i>, but the packaging
        apparently settled on just <i>Spirits</i>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="archive/Spirits_StyleGuide_051015-1_ebook.pdf">The
        internal style guide</a> mentioned that the game was not to be
        described in fantasy terms. As they put it, <q>There is no magic
        involved and no spells are cast</q>.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is said that the <i>spirits</i> are not as in the traditional
        meaning of the word. The actual definition however, is not made
        clear.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
      Everything I could find on SPIRITS impressed me deeply. While the
      graphics of the preliminary demo were still relatively colorful,
      it quickly became clear what SPIRITS would evolve into: a
      distinctive, unique game with a deep mythology that subtly
      interweaves the reality of SPIRITS with our own. An alternative
      reality that addresses both current world problems and ancient
      mythology, reflecting a world that seems to resemble ours, but is
      dominated by a dark and enigmatic allure.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also really like how SPIRITS has incorporated the player's
      N-Gage into the story, sort of as a tool to master the art of
      spirit control. I've only seen something similar in Ingress, an
      augmented reality MMO by Niantic, Inc. where the player's
      smartphone or tablet is turned into a scanner that is used to
      fight and capture enemy territory. However, this was in late 2013,
      almost a decade later. In retrospect, SPIRITS was definitely ahead
      of its time — a fact that doesn't seem to be an isolated case in
      the history of the Nokia N-Gage.
    </p>

    <p>
      No one can say for sure how and if SPIRITS would have been
      successful, but with the remaining N-Gage game library in mind and
      in contrast to Sega's Pocket Kingdom, we probably missed out on
      one of the best titles, and especially on one of the few that
      could have fully exploited the platform's potential.

      “[…] When Pokemon Go became a hit I thought alot of what could
      have been with the Spirits brand since they are quite
      similar. Sure, more Pokemons to collect but on the other hand the
      Spirit battle were actually fun”

      Of course, this article will not deprive you of the fabulous
      artwork and visuals of this unique world, and also the mythology
      that surrounds SPIRITS. I decided to present it separately and
      divide it into categories. These are organized as follows:

      I hope you enjoyed this article.  If not, let me know – I welcome
      constructive feedback to improve the quality of my content.  If
      you are interested in the Nokia N-Gage in general, you are
      cordially invited to visit our small online community.  You can
      find us
      on <a href="https://discord.gg/dbUzqJ26vs">Discord</a> and on
      <a href="https://t.me/nokia_ngage">Telegram</a>.

    <p>
      At this point I would like to thank my
      friends <a href="https://twitter.com/bewarerazvan">Razvan</a>
      and <a href="https://danwhelan.ie">Dan Whelan</a>, without whom
      this article would never have been possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would also like to thank Timo Weirich, owner and curator of the
      virtual online
      museum <a href="http://retro-net.de/">retro-net.de</a> for his
      continous support and insights, and glmdgrielson from
      the <a href="https://hitsave.org/">Hit Save!</a>-Discord for
      taking the time to revise this article in his fantastically
      nitpicky way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, I would, of course, like to thank all the people
      involved who so willingly invested time in giving me the
      information I was looking for. Without people like you, it would
      not be possible to preserve and pass on video game history.
