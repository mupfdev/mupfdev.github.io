        If you're not familiar with the Leisure Suit Larry franchise,
        I'd like to
        cite <a href="https://textfiles.libsyn.com/the-leisure-suit-larry-episode">Jason

      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “It's a game that is in no way defensible in the modern era,
        it's a relic of it's time, making reference to the fact that
        it's a relic of a previous time”

        This is the story of Leisure Suit Larry: Pocket Party. A game
        that Nokia invested literally millions in, to have it developed
        twice (you heard me right), only to ultimately cancel
        it. Whether this was a blessing or a curse, is for you to
        decide.

    <p>
      It must have been sometime between 1997 and 1998 when a
      prepubescent boy aged 10 came into possession of a 5.25" floppy
      disk that was to change his life forever. Even then, this floppy
      disk was a relic from another time, but the fascination it exuded
      was undimmed.
    <p>

    <p>
      Or shall we say: the fascination for the promise that emanated
      from it — a promise to a boy who was just about to get to know and
      explore this part of his world and interest.
    </p>

    <p>
      The diskette contained nothing but Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry in
      the Land of the Lounge Lizards from 1987 and that boy was me.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is where it all began.<br>

      This is where I came in contact with adventure games, where I
      learned English twice as fast as I did in school, without the
      internet or anyone I could have asked without blushing
      first. Armed only with a dictionary and the desire to pass the
      game's age verification quiz.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a Nokia N-Gage fan from the very beginning, my reaction was
      obvious when Nokia announced on April 21, 2004<label for="sn-1"

    <p>
      Assume the role of Larry Lovage, nephew of the original Larry
      Laffer, and are immediately challenged by Larry’s lack of social
      skills, charm, style and luck. In Leisure Suit Larry: Pocket
      Party, players explore an extensive and highly detailed 3D college
      campus, while solving puzzles and engaging in risque
      activities. As they search for the ultimate good time, gamers bump
      into Rosie Palmer, the head cheerleader at Larry’s
      college. Attempting to win over Rosie’s heart, Larry is thoroughly
      embarrassed by her jock boyfriend Chuck Rockwell --humiliation
      never stopped Larry before and he is determined to do anything to
      be with Rosie.<label for="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle

    <p class="free-standing">
      Apart from a few promotional screenshots and a description, the
      fact that it will be the first N-Gage game to use cel shading
      technology, which was still very rarely used at the time, nothing
      much was ever revealed about the game apart from the publisher
      and that TKO Software, who were already working on The Elder
      Scrolls Travels: Shadowkey at the time, would take over
      development. Nothing else tangible. The game remained in
      obscurity and was quietly cancelled at some point.

    <h3 class="free-standing" id="about-what-happened">About what happened</h3>

    <p>
      What certainly no one knew at the time, and no one could have
      guessed either, was that the development cycle of the game was
      almost complete. Not once, no, but twice, as both the TKO studio
      in Santa Cruz, California and their offshoot in Dallas, Texas made
      their own, distinct versions.<br>

      It is important to mention, however, that this did not happen at
      the same time, but was ultimately accompanied by a move of the
      mobile game department from Santa Cruz to Ireland with the N-Gage
      division being relocated to Dallas. As beautiful and half-true as
      the story of the two entirely different versions is, the
      development just got transferred, a decision based on the mobile
      games director leaving and starting his own company.
    </p>

    <h4 id="the-downside">The Downside</h4>

    <p>
      Let's stay in Santa Cruz for now, where the story of Leisure Suit
      Larry: Pocket Party, or as it was originally called — Leisure Suit
      Larry: Call of Booty<label for="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3"
      class="sidenote-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Everyone in the
      office loved that name — everyone except Activision who were
      working on Call of Duty at the time so this idea got nixed and
      they decided, despite some serious objections, to play
      nice.</span> — began.
    </p>

    <p>
      To give you a rough idea of the studio's relatively small line-up,
      the mobile division in Santa Cruz literally consisted of 6 people:
      an artist, Eric Calande, two programmers, including Jerry Shaw who
      worked on 1988's Police Quest II: The Vengeance, Adam Danielski as
      producer, Jody Hicks as the game's creative director, and Ben
      Nichols, as the director and department lead.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, there was another producer in charge from Nokia
      Vancouver who was substantially involved in the production of the
      game but had drastically different ideas and wanted lines to be
      pushed.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to the stories, the producer basically once said:
      <q>We need to make a puzzle where you use sexual hand signals</q>,
      and he holds up his hand in the <i>shocker</i> pose saying <q>When
      he goes to the frat party, to get in he will need to show the
      bouncer the Shocker, Rocker, Spocker or the Knocker.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      That was on the edge of the raunchy side that they were willing to
      do, but nothing further. There was no racism present and their job
      was to make sure to keep the spirit of the original
      game. Euphemisms, but not outright blatant sexual acts. This
      wasn't good enough for Nokia so they kept pressuring to get more
      sexual acts and whatnot. The team at TKO tried to get around this
      and constantly refused a lot of things.
    </p>

      <img class="image-zoom gallery-4x1" src="img/lsl-4.png" alt="Pocket Party screenshot">
    </div>

    <p class="free-standing">
      The engine develoment was taking time and they got to first
      playable <q>not funny enough</q> and <q>not raunchy
      enough</q>. Feature creep started rolling in. They hired some
      comedy writers, paid by Nokia, to come up with the dialogue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Expectations on Nokia's side increased, while development was to
      be sped up. According to Al Lowe, who once spoke to the programmer
      about the project, said that to his knowledge Nokia's only goal
      was to <q>grind it out as cheaply and quickly as possible</q>, and
      that wasn't so far-fetched: one artist, one designer, one
      programmer — that was the typical team for mobile games back then
      and mobile games were often developed in 3 months or less at that
      time. That was the norm to measure up to, but impossible to meet
      after all the feature requests from the game's publisher.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, when it was said that the game had to have a multiplayer
      mode, it became really time-consuming, unpleasant and expensive.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end there seems to be agreement on one thing: the reason
      why it was never released and here I would like to quote a former
      TKO Dallas employee:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Nokia Vancouver totally screwed it up from our original vision
      and made it vulgar to the point where it was completely
      unreleasable.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Jody Hicks, former creative director of TKO Santa Cruz, who even
      met with Al Lowe and really tried to capture the spirit of the
      originals, while updating it for a modern world, stumbles to this
      day when it comes to the game, saying:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “I'm not proud of the game, it's juvenile, sophomoric, and deeply
      tone-deaf with regards to racial stereotypes and overt
      sexualization of women. I won't ever share the design document I
      wrote as it does not reflect my personal views from the time when
      it was written or my personal standards and views of today. I was
      forced to write the game the way the publisher wanted it written,
      which was in a crass and "BroCentric" mentality, and while there
      are moments of the development cycle that brought me joy, the
      entire experience was demoralizing and embarrassing as a
      professional game designer.“
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In a nutshell: as bad as the Santa Cruz version was, the Dallas
      version ended up being much worse, at least from a content
      perspective. The Santa Cruz version was shelved because it wasn't
      raunchy enough while the Dallas version was shelved for being too
      raunchy. Having seen it for myself, this is a gross
      understatement, to say the least.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe the squirrels actively pursuing the continuation of their
      own species at the beginning of the game, or the mini-game in
      which you throw quarters into a lady's cleavage until she loses
      her top due to the sheer weight of the coins. <i>Yes, really, and
      that's just the beginning.</i>
    </p>

    <div class="gallery">
      <img class="image-zoom gallery-4x1" src="img/lsl-5.png" alt="Pocket Party screenshot">
      <img class="image-zoom gallery-4x1" src="img/lsl-6.png" alt="Pocket Party screenshot">

    </div>

    <p class="free-standing">
      I would like to emphasise at this point that I do not blame any of
      the developers or anyone else involved at TKO for this catastrophe
      in terms of content. On the contrary: In the end, the game was
      never released, as a result of meddling by the publisher. They had
      twisted ideas that made the game's release untenable which, sounds
      even more amazing when you consider that Nokia invested roughly
      1.4 million, about how much Leisure Suit Larry 7: Love for Sail!
      costs, to make this game twice. They had wild ideas and disagreed
      with the people who had the experience required to implement these
      ideas in a proper way, that would suit the player audience, to the
      point where — ultimately — they had gone too far. The game was
      simply too 'x-rated' for release and once that point was reached,
      where it was no longer possible to make a U-turn, it was already
      too late.
    </p>

    <h4 id="the-upside">The Upside</h4>
    <p>
      Well, is there anything positive to say about this game at all?
      You bet there is! And I am very happy to say that this is mainly
      regarding the technical aspect!
    <p>

    <p>
      As dull and tone-deaf as the game is in terms of content, it was
      technically sophisticated and flawlessly executed. Especially in
      regards to other titles for the Nokia N-Gage platform. This was
      shaping up to be a decent game.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="img/lsl-mmc.png"><img class="centered" src="img/lsl-mmc-tn.png" alt="LSL development card"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
      By the standards of those times and the modest size of the
      development studio, the game looks great. As advertised, it uses
      cartoon-like 3D graphics — aka cel shading — and it runs
      smoothly. The soundtrack is a bit monotonous, but fitting, and
      there is even a background narrator who introduces the
      story. However, I cannot say to what extent and whether this plays
      a role in the latter course of the game. All in all, it seems to
      be a fleshed out game that was almost ready to hit the
      stores. Created by developers who did their jobs well and knew how
      to use the tools they were given, but how the head of Nokia might
      have said when he saw the game, <q>This is by far the best looking
      game I've seen for the N-Gage, and there's no way in hell we can
      release it</q>.

    <h3 class="free-standing" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
      Looking back on all my research, I'm satisfied with just how much
      I was able to learn about the game and how open and interested all
      those who worked on this title were, even though it didn't end
      well.
    </p>

    <p>
      The story of this game may be unusual, but at the same time it
      reflects the everyday life and reality of a studio that is
      committed to a fully externally financed project. It points out
      the problems that arise when publishers have a completely
      different idea of what a game should have in order to be
      successful: raunchyness instead of a soul, and in this particular
      case, indelicacy instead of a healthy sense of tact. Two simple
      things that might have made this story turn out differently.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can say little about the whereabouts of the game here, but: from
      a preservationist's point of view, I am glad that at least the
      version made by TKO Dallas is safe. Including the source code, all
      assets such as source art, design and tech documentation,
      milestones and even whiteboard design pictures.
    </p>

    <p>
      And while I share Jody Hick's views and agree with them
      completely, I still hope that one day it will be available to a
      wider audience. At the end of the day, many people worked on it
      for months, only for no one to play it.
    </p>
